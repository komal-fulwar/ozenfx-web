        <h1>Risk Warning</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>At Ozenfx, we value transparency and client education. Please read this Risk Warning carefully before engaging in any trading activities. Investing in Contract for Difference (CFD) products carries a high degree of risk. The leverage often obtainable in CFD trading means that even a small market movement can result in a proportionately larger movement in the value of your investment. This can work both for and against you.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> CFD - Contract For Differences</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Risks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gearing and Leverage:</strong> CFDs offer the potential for significant gains, but they also introduce the risk of substantial losses. The leverage inherent in CFD trading can amplify market movements, leading to rapid changes in the value of your investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin Calls:</strong> A volatile market can necessitate additional funds with little or no notice. Failure to meet margin requirements may result in the closure of your positions, potentially incurring significant losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Losses Beyond Your Deposit:</strong> It is possible to lose more money than you have initially deposited into your trading account. You should be prepared for such scenarios and only invest funds you can afford to lose.</li>
            <li><strong>Informed Decision-Making:</strong> You must take responsibility for understanding and managing the risks associated with CFD trading. This includes having adequate financial resources to handle potential losses and seeking professional advice when necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>Seek professional or legal advice if you have any doubts regarding CFD products, services, or transactions. We (<a href="https://ozenfx.com">ozenfx.com</a>) strongly recommend consulting with our experts before entering into any financial agreement.</p>

        <h2>Your Responsibility</h2>
        <p>It is your responsibility to remain informed about the risks involved in CFD trading. You should continuously monitor your positions and be prepared to take appropriate actions.</p>

        <h2>Personalized Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>While this Risk Warning provides an overview of the general risks associated with CFD trading, it may not address all aspects or relate to your specific circumstances. You should conduct a personalized risk assessment and seek professional guidance to ensure your investments align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>

        <h2>Part of the Client Agreement</h2>
